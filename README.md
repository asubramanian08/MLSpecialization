## MLSpecialization
Coursera's [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) by Stanford University. Consists of:
* [Supervised Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)
* [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)
* [Unsupervised Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-learning-recommenders-reinforcement-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)

### About
I took this [specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) in the summer of 2022. Andrew Ng and a few other instructors teaches all kinds of different subjects in machine learning from supervised to unsupervised to reinforcement learning. I started off knowing little to nothing about machine learning and how implement ML consents. This course has really given me an understanding of ML at its core, along with practical ML applications. I would 100% recommend [this specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) to anyone interested in getting started with ML.
