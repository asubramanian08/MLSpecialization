## MLSpecialization
Coursera's [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) by Stanford University. Consists of:
* [Supervised Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)
* [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)
* [Unsupervised Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-learning-recommenders-reinforcement-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)

### About
I took this [specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) in the summer of 2022. Andrew Ng and a few other instructors teaches all kinds of different subjects in machine learning from supervised to unsupervised to reinforcement learning. I started off knowing little to nothing about machine learning and how implement ML consents. This course has really given me an understanding of ML at its core, along with practical ML applications. I would 100% recommend [this specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) to anyone interested in getting started with ML.

### Organization
* Folder: The course in the specialization
    * Multiple Folders: "Section of lectures" named "*Week#*.*section#*-*sectionDescription*"
        * Multiple Files: Notes for each lecture - outlines the main ideas
        * *private* PDF: Lecture
        * *private* Markdown: Quiz (graded)
        * *optional, private* Jupyter Notebook: Optional Lab
    * _optional_ Jupyter Notebook: Week's Lab (graded)

There is a folder for each individual course in the specialization. Each course folder contains a folder for each "section of lectures". There might  named "*Week#*.*section#*-*sectionDescription*". Within each such section folder there is:
Each topic has its own folder:
* The folder is named (week#).(topic#)-(Description)
* Notes for each sub-section named (section#)-(Description).(txt/md)
* Lecture PDF _private_
* Quiz with question, answers, and score _private_
* Octave exercise in a zip file _possibly there_
* Programming code (in Octave 3.8.0) expanded octave zip file with exercises complete _private, possibly_

For programming exercises and submissions: There are two programming languages that can be used: Octave or MATLAB. For both some files are given for submissions and exercises described in [EnvironmentInstructions.txt](https://github.com/asubramanian08/MachineLearning/blob/master/EnvironmentInstructions.txt). There are also set up instructions for both Octave and MATLAB in [2.1-MultiVarLinearRegression/1-EnvironmentSetup.txt](https://github.com/asubramanian08/MachineLearning/blob/master/2.1-MultiVarLinearRegression/1-EnvironmentSetup.txt).
