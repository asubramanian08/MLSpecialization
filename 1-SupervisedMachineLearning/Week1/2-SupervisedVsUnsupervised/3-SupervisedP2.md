* Classification algorithms
    * Ex. building a system to determine breast cancer ?(0/1)
    * Plot as: $x$ is the tumor size and $y$ is 0/1 if the tumor is malignant
    * NOTE: Can predict more than one catagories or classes of items
    * Classes or groups a limited number of catagories unlike regression
    * NOTE: We can also use multiple inputs

        For example: Age and Tumor size could be two factors
* 2 Major types of supervised learning
    1. Regression:
        * Predict a number
        * Infinite possible outputs
    2. Classification
        * Predicts catagories
        * Limited possible outputs
* Question

    Supervised learning is when we give our learning algorithm the right answer $y$  for each example to learn from.  Which is an example of supervised learning?

    * [x] Spam filtering
    * [ ] Calculating the average age of a group of customers.

    For instance, emails labeled as "spam" or "not spam" are examples used for training a supervised learning algorithm. The trained algorithm will then be able to predict with some degree of accuracy whether an unseen email is spam or not.
