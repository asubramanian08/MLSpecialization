* Arthur Samuel: Machine learning is "the field of study that givens computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."
    * Arthur created a checkers program train using many game plays
    * Eventually the program was able to beat Arthur himself
* Question:

    If Arthur Samuel's checkers-playing program had been allowed to play only 10 games (instead of tens of thousands games) against itself, how would this have affected its performance?
    
    * [ ] Would have made it better
    * [x] Would have made it worse

    That's right! Please continue the video to learn more about why.
* Machine Learning Algorithms
    * Supervised learning : course 1, 2
        
        Used most in real world applications (+ improvements)
    * Unsupervised learning : course 3
    * Recommender systems : course 3
    * Reinforcement learning : course 3

    This course will also teach how to apply these tools. What are the best practices?
