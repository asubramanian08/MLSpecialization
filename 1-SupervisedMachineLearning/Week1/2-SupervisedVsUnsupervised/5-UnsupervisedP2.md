* **Unsupervised learning**: Data only come at input $x$ and the algorithm tries to find *structure* in the data
* 3 main types of unsupervised learning
    1. Clustering: Grouping similar data points
    2. Anomaly Detection: Finding unusual activity (credit card stealing)
    3. Compressing data: Reduce the amount of storage needed to store something
* Question:

    Of the following examples, which would you address using an unsupervised learning algorithm?  (Check all that apply.)

    * [x] Given a set of news articles found on the web, group them into sets of articles about the same stories.
    * [ ] Given email labeled as spam/not spam, learn a spam filter.
    * [x] Given a database of customer data, automatically discover market segments and group customers into different market segments.
    * [ ] Given a dataset of patients diagnosed as either having diabetes or not, learn to classify new patients as having diabetes or not.

    This a type of unsupervised learning called clustering
