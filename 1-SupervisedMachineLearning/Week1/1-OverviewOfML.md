# Welcome the Machine Learning!
* Many applications of machine learning
    * Google searching
    * Finding friends in a social media
    * Similar movie search recommendations
    * Voice recognitions
    * Email flagging as spam
* Machine learning is also used in businesses
    * Wind turbine location
    * Accurate medical diagnosis
    * CV for assembly line defects
* **Machine Learning**: The ability to make a computer do something without being explicitly programmed

# Applications of Machine Learning
* Machine learning grew out of a subfield of AI
    * AI could find the shortest path
    * Could write a programming for the interesting things
        * Speech Recognition
        * Self-drive car
    * We must have the computer learn itself how to do these things
* Most industries are likely to touch almost all felids of learning
* **AGI**: Artificial General Intelligence, human like robots
* AI/ML is estimate to create 13 trillion $ of value in 2030
    * There is a lot of potential for AI or ML
    * Lot of untapped felids that can use ML
