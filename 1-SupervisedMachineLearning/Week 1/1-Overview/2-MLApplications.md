* Machine learning grew out of a subfield of AI
    * AI could find the shortest path
    * Could write a programming for the interesting things
        * Speech Recognition
        * Self-drive car
    * We must have the computer learn itself how to do these things
* Most industries are likely to touch almost all felids of learning
* **AGI**: Artificial General Intelligence, human like robots
* AI/ML is estimate to create 13 trillion $ of value in 2030
    * There is a lot of potential for AI or ML
