* Supervised learning algorithms
    * $x \to y$ where $x$ is input and $y$ is the output label
    * Learns from being given the correct answers
* For example:

    Input(X) | Output(Y) | Application
    ---------|-----------|------------
    email | spam?(0/1) | spam filtering
    audio | text transcript | speech recognition
    English | Spanish | Translator
    ad,user_info | click?(0/1) | ads
    image | loc of other cars | self-driving cars
    image of phone | defect?(0/1) | visual inspection
* Regression can use supervised learning
    * Regression data is the $(x,y)$ point
    * $x$ is the input
    * $y$ is the labeled output
