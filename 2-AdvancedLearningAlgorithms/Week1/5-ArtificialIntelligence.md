# Is there are path to AGI
* ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence) -> Self Driving Cars, Smart Speakers
* AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) -> Anything that a human can do
* Why scaling the number of neurons in an NN won't help:
    * Logistic regression is much simpler that what the actual brain is doing
    * We don't actually understand much about the human brain
* The "only learning algorithms" hypothesis: One or a few learning algorithms can do a large variety of tasks
    * Evidence: The same piece of brain tissue can do a lot of tasks
    * Example: The auditory cortex's link the ear is severed, it will learn how to "see"
    * Note there are other examples given.
